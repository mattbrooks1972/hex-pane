# Hex Pane #

Display the current text file as hexadecimal in a new pane and renders invisibles.

# Worklist #
- highlighting with cursor in editor highlights output
- extend pulling from editor for other invisibles like \a
- make it not look as jarring
- more settings, prefix with 0x, suffix with h, all lower, all upper, etc.
- possibly to update to new editor on window change, and track that editors buffer
- possibly render output as 6col (address, g1, g2, g3, g4, format) table, with sticky table header toggleable in options
